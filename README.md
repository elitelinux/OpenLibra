OpenLibra
---------

**OpenLibra** is a web software that can create books stores, or any kind of store, easily. The main feature is a partial **WordPress plugins compatibility** and a **federate system that enables global searchs across all stores**.

It can be useful for store books, DVDs, music, videos, anything!

Built upon [Laravel 3.2][1] and [PHP-FIG][2]. All pieces have been decoupled into framework independent components.

> Since OpenLibra is dependent on Composer, you already have access to any package from the Packagist directory anytime you start a new project. That means you have **thousands of packages** at your fingertips!


All of this makes OpenLibra compatible with some [WordPress plugins][3], [Symfony2 bundles][4], [FuelPHP][5] or [CodeIgniter packages][6].

**OpenLibra is under development and it has no a stable version yet.**
